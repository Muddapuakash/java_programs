### 3.11 Git Best Practices for Java Development

**1. Commit Frequently**
```bash
# ✅ Good: Logical, small commits
git commit -m "Add Scanner input handling"
git commit -m "Fix buffer issue in age input"
git commit -m "Add formatted output display"

# ❌ Bad: One huge commit
git commit -m "Completed entire PersonalBioApp"
